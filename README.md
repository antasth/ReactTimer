## **About the project**

The pet project that I developed to study react and redux-toolkit.

## **Features**

1. Watches catalog  
   _The product catalog loads data from the mockapi storage. During loading, a skeleton is displayed instead of product cards. Product cards have a hover effect. When you hover over a card, a shadow appears and the buy button is highlighted. When you click the button, the product is added to the cart._
2. Pagination
   _Pagination allows you to go to the desired page, as well as change the number of products displayed on the page._
3. Sorting  
   _Allows you to sort products by default, by popularity, by price(descending or ascending) or by name._
4. Filtering  
   _Filtering allows you to display products by availability or type (mechanical, men's, women's, sports, classic)._
5. Search
   _When you enter a search string, only matching products are displayed in the catalog. A debounce for search query input has also been implemented.._
6. Cart
   _The cart displays the products added on the catalog page. It is possible to empty the cart or delete only one of the added products._
